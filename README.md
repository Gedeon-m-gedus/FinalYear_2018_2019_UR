# FinalYear Project_2018_2019_UR
This is a simple project, We did as our first step to python programming, We had an idea of making a simulation tool that could help students since they often suffer from insufficient access to lab and lab equipment.

The project is a graphical user interface, which has three main parts:
          
          1. Built in funcftions
          2. User defined functions
          3. External serial data ploting
          
 The logic behind is nothing but student can access built in functions which are the most signals and functions students in EEE field face. 
 Secondry, student can enter coeficients of function then do plot very easy.
 Lastly, if student is doing certain arduino based ploject hecan send data directly for real time plot.

 ###  steps to run the code
 - Download all the files and keep them into one directory
 - Install all the required modules
 - Run the main file
