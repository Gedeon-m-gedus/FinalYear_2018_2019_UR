# FinalYear Project_2018_2019_UR
This is a simple project I have done as my first step to python programming, I had an idea of making a simulation tool that could help students since they suffer from insufficient access to lab and lab equipment.

The project i a graphical user interface, which has three main parts:
          
          1. Built in funcftions
          2. User defined functions
          3. External serial data ploting
          
 The logic behind is nothing but student can access built in functions which are the most signals and functions students in EEE field face. 
 Secondry, student can enter coeficients of function then do plot very easy.
 Lastly, if student is doing certain arduino based ploject hecan send data directly for real time plot.
